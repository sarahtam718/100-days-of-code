# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started this log and completed Lesson 18 from Wes Bos's JavaScript30 course.

**Thoughts:** We are off to a strong start! It feels good to "run with purpose." JavaScript30 seemed like a good place to begin and I think it is the right fit for now. Ideas are clicking better for me than they did when I first got out of the bootcamp.

**Skills:**

- converting iterable (ex. Node list) into an array with Array.from()
- passing a function through .map (ex. .map(parseFloat) --> array of strings to numbers)
- consolidate an array of elements into one using reduce
- finding the lowest integer using Math.floor() and the remainder (%) to convert seconds into hours:mins:seconds

**Link to work:** Total Video Times with Reduce - https://github.com/sarahtam718/javascript30-learning/commit/26f076aaaf4ac1efb589ea9cb7f26a0e9cd2f957

### Day 2: January 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Halfway through Unreal Webcam Fun Lesson 19 of Javascript 30

**Thoughts:** Not as productive as yesterday...It threw me off that some parts of the tutorial were outdated, so I had to find the updated solution. I feel like it was a good reality check of problem-solving though. I had to ask why something isn't working and then test my hypothesis and figure it out until it works.

**Skills:**

- accessing webcam --> srcObject, the media stream promise
- using canvas, like .drawImage
- problem-solving "Why isn't this working?"

### Day 3: January 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: So, football...

**Thoughts:** I was reflecting on the idea that I need to go back even further to the fundamentals of the language. Then, I can take better advantage of JavaScript30's application of the fundamentals. (I want to make sure that I'm applying what I learn, too.)

**Skills:** basic JavaScript like how to add <src> tags to HTML, find an element's datatype, construct a template literal, let vs const (why const should be the go-to for data integrity and clarity)

### Days 4-5: January 20-21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Determined to get certified through freeCodeCamp!

**Thoughts:** I don't love just watching a video and taking notes...so I found myself back where I was almost a year ago, during the web development bootcamp I took through Trilogy at Northwestern, in freeCodeCamp. They have these quick mini-lessons on the foundations, and I could get certified from them while building skills and projects for my portfolio. As I stated in my Tweet, this isn't the glamorous part - I want to make beautiful and functional things, but I'm just not ready yet. I am trying to show myself some grace as I am reviewing some basic array accessing and setting up functions. This is because I recognize so many ways that I cut myself short in a project I submitted for an amazing apprenticeship opportunity that I lost in the first round.

**Skills:**

- destructuring
- reassigning
- finding the remainder
- accessing arrays
- incrementing / decrementing
- escaping strings
- invoking and calling functions
- parameters & arguments

### Days 6-8: January 22-24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Demonstrated courage & curiosity

**Thoughts:** I am beyond thankful and excited to start this new journey at work. Since we are winding down from busy season, my workload has decreased significantly. I had been thinking a while ago that my team could find some tasks at least partially automated for efficiency and accuracy (by reducing human-interaction with data). I asked my manager if I could try automation with code, and he not only gave me permission to pursue that task but also asked if I could try to automate a special report from the database with code in addition to another higher-priority project. I did notice that my bootcamp SQL skills were coming back pretty sharp and that fundamental coding understanding helped me onboard to python more quickly than I expected. In these few days, I have been able to translate his first query into a query that Snowflake can understand as well as introduce a condition to determine what data should be passed into the next query for further investigation. Working with our Data Analytics person, we ran into some issues with the two instances of the db inconsistent to the extent that my work may be in vain...I'm still happy it worked! At the end of the last day, I was working on getting the Google Sheets API up and running to allow me to compare the results of the first query with data that we only store in Sheets. Not working - yet!

**Skills:**

- setting up python environment via Jupyter notebook & Anacondas
- connecting to Snowflake db
- modifying a complex SQL query
- reading documentation (Snowflake, Google Sheets API)
- connecting Google Sheets to Jupyter notebook

### Day 9: January 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Just over %50 complete in the Basic JavaScript portion of certification course on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Grateful to be back in JavaScript after a week of python and SQL. More dots are connecting.

**Skills:**

- scope of variables
- passing arguments into functions
- the purpose/functionality of the return statement
- == vs ===

### Day 10-14: January 27-31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I hit about 70% completion of my work project - wow!

**Thoughts:** Although Python feels like a whole new world, I am growing in confidence in my understanding of how computers / the browser / humans work together to make things happen. I had a coworker from the data science team help me with syntax and conceptualizing. Plus, I met with my manager (who the project is mainly for) and he was ecstatic about my progress - seeing the wider applicability of what I'm creating. It really helps to have a road map and set of tasks so that when I need a break from spinning my wheels on one aspect of the project, I can pursue another with fresh energy.

**Skills:**

- DataFrames in pandas
- to_csv in pandas
- renaming columns in a table of query results
- setting true/false conditions
- creating dynamic clauses to insert into a query for real-time results
- greater understanding of the database architecture at work

### Day 15: February 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: A couple Basic JavaScript modules from freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Good idea to have something productive to do (rather than being tempted to be on my phone) like coding on my down time while volunteering. Mostly lessons I felt pretty confident in already - I wish their new project-based curriculum was coming out soon so I could see more application and edge cases.

**Skills:**

- inequalities
- if else statements

### Day 16: February 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Doesn't feel like I made much...Finally caught up on this log!

**Thoughts:** I pursued a few different topics related to my query work project. Mostly reading documentation on how to connect query results to Slack, run Jupyter Notebooks automatically, and convert DataFrames to_excel (instead of to_csv). I didn't do much typing, but I know reading documentation is a skill that although hard to measure progress on is worth something.

**Skills:**

- reading documentation
- benefits and drawback of to_csv vs to_excel in pandas

### Day 17-20: February 4-7, 2020

**Week's Progress**: More familiarity with python and using jupyter notebook and distinguishing when and how many parameters to use

**Thoughts:** I used VS Code LiveShare to do a short code wars problem with a mentor I met through a DevTogether meetup. That was really helpful because he thought aloud, which revealed how an expert thinks through a coding problem. At work, I met almost everyday with the Data Analytics person and twice with my manager. We solved little problems like figuring out I wasn't returning anything, so that is why my function wasn't "working." I connected with the only and recently-hired engineer in the office - great opportunity to share what I was working on and learn that he is a great resource because we are working in the same language. I am a bit torn on focusing between splitting my time on JavaScript at home and Python at work or all of my attention on Python...

**Skills:**

- purpose of the number of arguments as parameters in a function
- return something from a function and feed it to another function
- stringing functions together in a giant function to make code more readable & efficient
- how to make functions more reusable by replacing hard-coded elements

### Day 21: February 9, 2020

**Week's Progress**: Two freeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript modules

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot of time problem-solving, with more or less success. Perseverance and creativity are the keys!

**Skills:**

- attention to detail
- switch statements syntax

### Day 22: February 11, 2020

**Week's Progress**: 23% closer to finishing Basic JavaScript modules on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Though I want to build projects, I recognize my need for these modules to build my skills and break down misconceptions. Patience and perseverance will win out!

**Skills:** accessing objects and arrays, case statements, complex if else statements

### Day 23: February 12, 2020

**Week's Progress**: 10% closer to finishing Basic JavaScript modules on freeCodeCamp (9% away from completion)

**Thoughts:** Really solidified differences between loops and purpose of each item in a loop (not that I've used them much in React with .map, but good to go back to how it works). Recursion is tricky - definitely need to look into it further because it does seem more efficient.

**Skills:** while loop, for loop, do while loop, intro to recursion
