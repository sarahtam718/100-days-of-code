# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started this log and completed Lesson 18 from Wes Bos's JavaScript30 course.

**Thoughts:** We are off to a strong start! It feels good to "run with purpose." JavaScript30 seemed like a good place to begin and I think it is the right fit for now. Ideas are clicking better for me than they did when I first got out of the bootcamp.

**Skills:**

- converting iterable (ex. Node list) into an array with Array.from()
- passing a function through .map (ex. .map(parseFloat) --> array of strings to numbers)
- consolidate an array of elements into one using reduce
- finding the lowest integer using Math.floor() and the remainder (%) to convert seconds into hours:mins:seconds

### Day 2: January 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Halfway through Unreal Webcam Fun Lesson 19 of Javascript 30

**Thoughts:** Not as productive as yesterday...It threw me off that some parts of the tutorial were outdated, so I had to find the updated solution. I feel like it was a good reality check of problem-solving though. I had to ask why something isn't working and then test my hypothesis and figure it out until it works.

**Skills:**

- accessing webcam --> srcObject, the media stream promise
- using canvas, like .drawImage
- problem-solving "Why isn't this working?"

### Day 3: January 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: So, football...

**Thoughts:** I was reflecting on the idea that I need to go back even further to the fundamentals of the language. Then, I can take better advantage of JavaScript30's application of the fundamentals. (I want to make sure that I'm applying what I learn, too.)

**Skills:** basic JavaScript like how to add <src> tags to HTML, find an element's datatype, construct a template literal, let vs const (why const should be the go-to for data integrity and clarity)

### Day 4-5: January 20-21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Let's get certified!

**Thoughts:** I don't love just watching a video and taking notes...so I found myself back where I was almost a year ago, during the web development bootcamp I took through Trilogy at Northwestern, in freeCodeCamp. They have these quick mini-lessons on the foundations, and I could get certified from them while building skills and projects for my portfolio. As I stated in my Tweet, this isn't the glamorous part - I want to make beautiful and functional things, but I'm just not ready yet. I am trying to show myself some grace as I am reviewing some basic array accessing and setting up functions. This is because I recognize so many ways that I cut myself short in a project I submitted for an amazing apprenticeship opportunity that I lost in the first round.

**Skills:**

- destructuring
- reassigning
- finding the remainder
- accessing arrays
- incrementing / decrementing
- escaping strings
- invoking and calling functions
