# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started this log and completed Lesson 18 from Wes Bos's JavaScript30 course.

**Thoughts:** We are off to a strong start! It feels good to "run with purpose." JavaScript30 seemed like a good place to begin and I think it is the right fit for now. Ideas are clicking better for me than they did when I first got out of the bootcamp.

**Skills:**

- converting iterable (ex. Node list) into an array with Array.from()
- passing a function through .map (ex. .map(parseFloat) --> array of strings to numbers)
- consolidate an array of elements into one using reduce
- finding the lowest integer using Math.floor() and the remainder (%) to convert seconds into hours:mins:seconds

### Day 2: January 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Halfway through Unreal Webcam Fun Lesson 19 of Javascript 30

**Thoughts:** Not as productive as yesterday...It threw me off that some parts of the tutorial were outdated, so I had to find the updated solution. I feel like it was a good reality check of problem-solving though. I had to ask why something isn't working and then test my hypothesis and figure it out until it works.

**Skills:**

- accessing webcam --> srcObject, the media stream promise
- using canvas, like .drawImage
- problem-solving "Why isn't this working?"
