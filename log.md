# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started this log and completed Lesson 18 from Wes Bos's JavaScript30 course.

**Thoughts:** We are off to a strong start! It feels good to "run with purpose." JavaScript30 seemed like a good place to begin and I think it is the right fit for now. Ideas are clicking better for me than they did when I first got out of the bootcamp.

**Skills:**

- converting iterable (ex. Node list) into an array with Array.from()
- passing a function through .map (ex. .map(parseFloat) --> array of strings to numbers)
- consolidate an array of elements into one using reduce
- finding the lowest integer using Math.floor() and the remainder (%) to convert seconds into hours:mins:seconds

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
