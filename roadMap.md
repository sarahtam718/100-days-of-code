# What are my big goals?

- Complete 5-6 projects that showcase mostly my front-end skills in JavaScript and React, with potential for 1-2 full stack apps

  - Todo Toast (needs deployment trouble-shooting) [ full stack ]
  - Simple Weather App that helps you decide what to wear [ front-end ]
  - Watering Scheduler (needs fixing) [ front-end ]

- Update and style my personal portfolio site

- Figure out how to get a domain name & faster loading for personal site + deployed apps (Netlify? Paid Heroku?)

- Get to lower levels of CodeWars

- Master vanilla & ES6 JavaScript

- Master React.js

- Feel comfortable with creating simple MERN or SQL-ERN stack apps

- Get a front-end or full-stack web developer position (maybe at my current workplace?)
